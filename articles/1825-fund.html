        <h1 class="article-title">why 1825 fund exists</h1>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>i grew up in a small town and loved building things: hardware, software, <span class="cyan">anything i
                    could figure out</span>.</p>

            <p>what i didn't have was <span class="orange">access</span>.</p>

            <p>no strong network. no mentors around me. and experimenting with hardware was expensive.</p>

            <p>when i was around <span class="yellow stat">13</span>, during COVID, i taught myself whatever i could. i
                built random projects like a website that got <span class="green stat">30k</span> users, small games in
                unity for my girlfriend, experiments with a 3d printer just to see what was possible. none of it was
                polished. it was just <span class="pink">curiosity</span>.</p>

            <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;" class="inline-media"><iframe
                    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1148846879?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&muted=1&loop=1"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border-radius:12px;"
                    title="3d printer experiments"></iframe></div>

            <p>i was lucky. i eventually found my way.</p>

            <p>a lot of kids don't.</p>

            <p>back then, i promised myself one thing:</p>

            <p><span class="purple">if i ever had the chance, i wouldn't let lack of access be the reason someone gives
                    up.</span></p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">before there was a fund</h2>

            <p>before the 1825 fund had a name, i just started showing up.</p>

            <p>i hosted small, free workshops in jhansi. i invited teenagers, many complete beginners, and taught them
                how to build their first website, how the internet works, and how to think about tech and startups.</p>

            <p>one time, i shared a simple event link in a few whatsapp groups and on reddit.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow stat">18</span> people showed up. <span class="cyan stat">14</span> of them were
                complete strangers.</p>

            <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;" class="inline-media"><iframe
                    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1148849623?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&muted=1&loop=1"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border-radius:12px;"
                    title="Hackclub Jhansi"></iframe></div>

            <p>by the end of the day, they had <span class="green">websites live on the internet</span>. later, we all
                went out for pizza, paid for it ourselves, because effort deserves celebration.</p>

            <p>later, i organized <a href="daydream-jhansi.html">daydream jhansi</a>, a 24-hour game jam for students
                aged 13-18. they built games from scratch, published them online, and kept everything open source.
                everyone got food. no entry fees. no pressure.</p>

            <p>a <span class="purple">16-year-old</span> built my favorite game that weekend.</p>

            <p>check it out: <a href="https://shre-linux.itch.io/daydream"
                    target="_blank">https://shre-linux.itch.io/daydream</a></p>

            <p>that's when it clicked.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">why 1825 fund exists</h2>

            <p>if you're <span class="yellow">16-22 in india</span> and genuinely building something:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>you're too early for VCs</li>
                <li>too ambitious for parents</li>
                <li>too unknown for grants</li>
            </ul>

            <p>good ideas don't fail because they're bad.</p>

            <p>they fail because <span class="orange">no one backs them early enough</span>.</p>

            <p>1825 fund exists to be that <span class="cyan">first signal of belief</span>.</p>

            <p>we give small, fast, <span class="green">no-equity grants</span> to young builders under 25.</p>

            <p>no pitch decks. no degrees. no revenue requirements.</p>

            <p>just: <span class="pink">show us what you're already building.</span></p>

            <p>an example of a project we fund could be something like this <span class="cyan">3d printed hall effect
                    keyboard</span> i built last year:</p>

            <div style="padding:56.31% 0 0 0;position:relative;" class="inline-media"><iframe
                    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1148852586?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&muted=1&loop=1"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border-radius:12px;"
                    title="Hall effect keyboard"></iframe></div>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">our first fellows</h2>

            <p>we started small, using personal funds.</p>

            <p><strong>manan (16), ASTRA-V</strong></p>

            <p>manan is 16 and building <span class="cyan">ASTRA-V</span>, a vertical landing rocket project.</p>

            <p>when i asked him what the biggest challenge was, he didn't say exams or time. he said he's trying to
                figure out the fuel system, how to make it reliable enough so the rocket doesn't fail mid-air.</p>

            <p>hearing that from a 16-year old really put things in perspective.</p>

            <p>manan recently told us that version 1 of the flight controller is ready and will be tested in the coming
                days.</p>

            <div style="padding:56.37% 0 0 0;position:relative;" class="inline-media"><iframe
                    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1148855179?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&muted=1&loop=1"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border-radius:12px;"
                    title="Manan, 16"></iframe></div>

            <p><strong>vishesh (17), nano mail</strong></p>

            <p>vishesh built <span class="purple">nano mail</span>, an open-source disposable email service focused on
                privacy.</p>

            <p>it's live. people use it. and it was built entirely by a high-school student.</p>

            <p>we funded vishesh to help with hosting, scaling, and improving the product so it could keep running.</p>

            <p><em>(will write a detailed blog about Manan and Vishesh)</em></p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">what we're learning</h2>

            <p>money helps, but <span class="orange">belief matters more</span>.</p>

            <p>we're also in conversation with programs like <span class="green">Z Fellows</span>, where strong 1825
                fund fellows may be fast-tracked for interviews, based on the quality of their work.</p>

            <p>the goal isn't just funding.</p>

            <p>it's <span class="pink">visibility, confidence, and access</span> to our network.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">emergent ventures</h2>

            <p>recently, i received a grant from <span class="cyan">emergent ventures</span> to continue doing this work
                and fund many more young builders.</p>

            <p>it also means i'm moving to <span class="yellow">bangalore</span> to be closer to the startup ecosystem
                and help more people.</p>

            <p>this is still very early. we're learning as we go. we'll make mistakes. we'll get better.</p>

            <p>but if even one 17-year-old from a small town keeps building instead of giving up because of this, <span
                    class="green">it's worth it</span>.</p>

            <p>that's all this is.</p>
