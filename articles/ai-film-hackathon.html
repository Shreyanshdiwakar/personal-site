        <div class="article-content">
            <p>last november, i participated in <span class="cyan">india's biggest AI filmmaking hackathon</span>.</p>

            <p>the selection process was pretty straightforward but tough. submit a one minute film. theme was japan.
            </p>

            <p>for our submission, we made this video:</p>
            <p><a href="https://x.com/shubhxho/status/1978473438361891260"
                    target="_blank">https://x.com/shubhxho/status/1978473438361891260</a></p>

            <p>what happened next surprised all of us.</p>

            <p>the video started spreading. like, actually spreading. it went viral on X, got reposted everywhere, and
                random people started reaching out. teams from <span class="yellow">Y Combinator backed startups</span>,
                including Landeed, asked if we could make commercials for them.</p>

            <p>the moment that really hit was when <span class="purple">Runtime featured our video themselves</span>:
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://x.com/runtimebrt/status/1982430075195896080"
                    target="_blank">https://x.com/runtimebrt/status/1982430075195896080</a></p>

            <p>we didn't end up making the top 50 teams who were flown to mumbai. but honestly? that stopped mattering.
            </p>

            <p>what i did gain was something more valuable. i learned <span class="green">how to make content go viral
                    using AI</span>. not by luck. by actually understanding pacing, visuals, hooks, and distribution.
            </p>

            <p>about a week later, i was invited to <span class="pink">RISE Incubator</span> in jhansi.</p>

            <p>that visit changed the direction of this whole story.</p>

            <p>i met incredibly talented founders and builders working on solid startups. the problem wasn't product or
                effort. it was <span class="orange">visibility</span>. most of them didn't know how to market themselves
                online. and many didn't have the budget to hire agencies or creators.</p>

            <p>so i asked a simple question. why not just teach them what i learned?</p>

            <p>i decided to organize a hands on workshop on creating viral startup content using AI. practical. no
                fluff.</p>

            <p>to make it accessible, i partnered with <span class="cyan">Morphic</span>, who provided Morphic Pro
                accounts to all attendees so the workshop could be fully hands on.</p>

            <p>the response was bigger than i expected.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow stat">60</span> people showed up. <span class="purple stat">40</span> in person and
                <span class="green stat">20</span> online.</p>

            <p>everyone who attended got <span class="orange">free pizza and snacks</span>, because learning works
                better when people are relaxed and feel welcome.</p>

            <p>the workshop wasn't about "growth hacks" or chasing trends. it was about:</p>
            <ul class="project-links">
                <li>telling a clear story</li>
                <li>using AI as a tool, not a crutch</li>
                <li>and helping good work reach the people it deserves to reach</li>
            </ul>

            <p>looking back, the most interesting part isn't that a video went viral.</p>

            <p>it's that one experiment turned into shared knowledge. and that knowledge helped a local startup
                community <span class="green">show up better online</span>.</p>

            <p>that's the kind of ripple effect i care about.</p>
