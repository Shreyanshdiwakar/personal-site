        <h1 class="article-title">from ai film hackathon to teaching startups how to go viral</h1>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>last november, i participated in <span class="cyan">india's biggest AI filmmaking hackathon</span>.</p>

            <p>the selection process was pretty straightforward but tough. submit a one minute film. theme was japan.
            </p>

            <p>for our submission, we made this video:</p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><a
                    href="https://twitter.com/shubhxho/status/1978473438361891260"></a></blockquote>

            <p>what happened next surprised all of us.</p>

            <p>the video started spreading. like, actually spreading. it went viral on X, got reposted everywhere, and
                random people started reaching out. teams from <span class="yellow">Y Combinator backed startups</span>,
                including Landeed, asked if we could make commercials for them.</p>

            <p>the moment that really hit was when <span class="purple">Runtime featured our video themselves</span>:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><a
                    href="https://twitter.com/runtimebrt/status/1982430075195896080"></a></blockquote>
            <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

            <p>we didn't end up making the top 50 teams who were flown to mumbai. but honestly? that stopped mattering.
            </p>

            <p>what i did gain was something more valuable. i learned <span class="green">how to make content go viral
                    using AI</span>. not by luck. by actually understanding pacing, visuals, hooks, and distribution.
            </p>

            <p>about a week later, i was invited to <span class="pink">RISE Incubator</span> in jhansi.</p>

            <p>that visit changed the direction of this whole story.</p>

            <img src="../images/aiflim/IMG_5047.JPG" alt="RISE Incubator visit" class="inline-media">

            <p>i met incredibly talented founders and builders working on solid startups. the problem wasn't product or
                effort. it was <span class="orange">visibility</span>. most of them didn't know how to market themselves
                online. and many didn't have the budget to hire agencies or creators.</p>

            <p>so i asked a simple question. why not just teach them what i learned?</p>

            <p>i decided to organize a hands on workshop on creating viral startup content using AI. practical. no
                fluff.</p>

            <p>to make it accessible, i partnered with <span class="cyan">Morphic</span>, who provided Morphic Pro
                accounts to all attendees so the workshop could be fully hands on.</p>

            <p>the response was bigger than i expected.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow stat">60</span> people showed up. <span class="purple stat">40</span> in person and
                <span class="green stat">20</span> online.
            </p>

            <div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;" class="inline-media"><iframe
                    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1151230289?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&autoplay=1&muted=1&loop=1"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share"
                    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border-radius:12px;"
                    title="Workshop video"></iframe></div>

            <p>everyone who attended got <span class="orange">free pizza and snacks</span>, because learning works
                better when people are relaxed and feel welcome.</p>

            <p>the workshop wasn't about "growth hacks" or chasing trends. it was about:</p>
            <ul class="project-links">
                <li>telling a clear story</li>
                <li>using AI as a tool, not a crutch</li>
                <li>and helping good work reach the people it deserves to reach</li>
            </ul>

            <p>looking back, the most interesting part isn't that a video went viral.</p>

            <p>it's that one experiment turned into shared knowledge. and that knowledge helped a local startup
                community <span class="green">show up better online</span>.</p>

            <p>that's the kind of ripple effect i care about.</p>
