        <div class="article-content">
            <p>what happens when you give teenagers <span class="yellow">24 hours</span>, free food, and permission to
                build whatever game they want?</p>

            <p>i wanted to find out.</p>

            <p>so i organized <span class="cyan">daydream jhansi</span> — a 24-hour game jam where students aged <span
                    class="purple">13–18</span> came together to build a game from scratch in just one day.</p>

            <p>over the course of 24 hours, participants formed teams, learned new tools, and shipped real games. many
                of them were <span class="green">building something like this for the first time</span>.</p>

            <p>to keep the event accessible, daydream jhansi was <span class="orange">completely free</span>. every
                participant received free food and unlimited snacks throughout the event, which helped keep the energy
                high and the environment collaborative.</p>

            <p>anyone who built and published their game on itch.io received <span class="pink">stickers and
                    merch</span>. we also ran community voting and awarded prizes for the best games.</p>

            <p>all games created during the jam were made <span class="cyan">open source</span> and uploaded to itch.io,
                so anyone can play them or contribute further.</p>

            <p>one of my favorite projects was built by a <span class="purple">16-year-old</span> participant:</p>
            <ul class="project-links">
                <li>itch.io: <a href="https://lnkd.in/g3rYdz_X" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/g3rYdz_X</a></li>
                <li>github: <a href="https://lnkd.in/gGT6A7Ap" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/gGT6A7Ap</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>the event received <span class="yellow stat">150+</span> signups, far beyond what we initially expected.
            </p>

            <p>to fund it, i personally reached out to builders and organizations i admired. after cold messaging the
                <span class="green">CTO of Zerodha</span>, we secured sponsorship support.</p>

            <p>in total, we raised <span class="orange stat">$2,000 USD</span> in prize money, with support from <span
                    class="cyan">FOSS United</span>, <span class="pink">Hack Club</span>, <span class="purple">Z
                    Fellows</span>, and others.</p>

            <p>daydream jhansi showed me how much <span class="green">untapped talent</span> exists when young people
                are given space, trust, and the right environment to build.</p>

            <p>many participants shipped their first real project that day — and that mattered more than any prize.</p>
