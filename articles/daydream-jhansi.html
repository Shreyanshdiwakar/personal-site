        <div class="article-content">
            <p>honestly? i just wanted to see what would happen if you gave a bunch of teenagers <span class="yellow">24
                    hours</span>, unlimited maggi, and told them to make a game.</p>

            <p>that's basically how <span class="cyan">daydream jhansi</span> started.</p>

            <p>the idea was simple — get students aged <span class="purple">13 to 18</span>, put them in a room
                together, and let them build whatever game they wanted. no restrictions. no "you should make this type
                of game." just... build something cool.</p>

            <p>i wasn't sure if anyone would even show up. jhansi is not exactly known for game dev or hackathons. but i
                made a website anyway, posted it everywhere, and hoped for the best.</p>

            <p>then the signups started coming in.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow stat">150+</span> people signed up. i was like... bhai kya ho raha hai.</p>

            <p>most of them had never made a game before. some had never even coded before. but they showed up anyway —
                with their laptops, their friends, and zero sleep the night before because they were too excited.</p>

            <p>to keep it accessible, we made the whole thing <span class="orange">completely free</span>. free entry,
                free food, free chai, unlimited snacks. because let's be real — if you're asking teenagers to stay awake
                for 24 hours straight, you better feed them properly.</p>

            <p>the energy was insane. teams were forming, people were learning godot and unity on the spot, random
                strangers became friends, and by hour 6, the room was basically chaos in the best way possible.</p>

            <p>everyone who finished and published their game on itch.io got <span class="pink">stickers and
                    merch</span>. we also did community voting to pick the best games — winners got actual prizes.</p>

            <p>one of my favourite projects was made by this <span class="purple">16-year-old</span> kid. he'd never
                made a game before. 24 hours later, he had a fully working game on the internet:</p>
            <ul class="project-links">
                <li>itch.io: <a href="https://lnkd.in/g3rYdz_X" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/g3rYdz_X</a></li>
                <li>github: <a href="https://lnkd.in/gGT6A7Ap" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/gGT6A7Ap</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>all the games are open source now. anyone can play them, fork them, or build on top of them.</p>

            <p>now here's the crazy part — funding this thing.</p>

            <p>i had no sponsors. no connections. just vibes and a lot of cold messages.</p>

            <p>i literally just dm'd the <span class="green">CTO of Zerodha</span> on twitter. told him what we were
                doing. and he said yes.</p>

            <p>in the end, we raised <span class="orange stat">$2,000 USD</span> in prize money. sponsors included <span
                    class="cyan">FOSS United</span>, <span class="pink">Hack Club</span>, <span class="purple">Z
                    Fellows</span>, and a bunch of other people who believed in what we were trying to do.</p>

            <p>looking back, daydream jhansi showed me something important — there's so much <span
                    class="green">untapped talent</span> in small towns. these kids just need someone to say "here's the
                space, here's the resources, now go build something."</p>

            <p>a lot of participants shipped their first real project that day. for some, it was the first time anyone
                told them their work mattered.</p>

            <p>that felt better than any prize money.</p>
