            <div class="article-content">
                <p>growing up in a small town, i was always into <span class="green">building new stuff</span> —
                    hardware or software.</p>

                <p>however, i didn't have access to the same network and resources that some teenagers would have in a
                    tier 1 city, and learning and experimenting with hardware can be a bit expensive.</p>

                <p>i was lucky enough to learn a lot of stuff by myself and create awesome projects like coding a fun
                    website for my girlfriend from scratch, or building a game in unity, or maybe experimenting with a
                    <span class="cyan">3d printer</span> to make it write my hw.
                </p>

                <p>back then, <span class="purple">13-year-old shreyansh</span> (during covid) promised himself that i
                    won't let that happen to other people in my community. despite getting into what some might call
                    prestigious universities like duke and northwestern, i took a gap year!</p>

                <p>now that i am grown up, i have decided, i'll host a <span class="cyan">fun club meeting/workshop
                        day</span> once every month where i'll invite teenagers like me or under 18. where i'll teach
                    them everything i know about <span class="orange">tech, hardware, finance, and startups!</span></p>

                <p>i even did one last month — created a website for the event, sent it to a couple of WhatsApp groups
                    and posted on my r/Jhansi.</p>

                <p>and surprisingly, <span class="yellow stat">18</span> people showed up. out of <span
                        class="purple stat">14</span> people were strangers.</p>

                <p>many of them were beginners, i taught them how to build their first website and got them <span
                        class="green">live on the internet</span>, coordinated with <span class="cyan">Hack Club</span>
                    (a nonprofit organization).</p>

                <p>here are a few websites they made:</p>
                <ul class="project-links">
                    <li>egg sheeran: <a href="https://lnkd.in/gP8UUREX" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/gP8UUREX</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>digital funhouse: <a href="https://lnkd.in/gwyM_d3v"
                            target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/gwyM_d3v</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>later we took everyone to <span class="orange">dominos pizza</span> and got everyone pizza for their
                    hard work!</p>

                <p>also this entire event wouldn't be possible without a venue and for that special thanks to <span
                        class="pink">Ankit Rajak</span>, <span class="cyan">RISE - JHANSI</span>, and <span
                        class="green">Mukul Dubey</span> for the finance workshop.</p>

                <p>later, after the club meet, we were lucky enough to get featured in <span class="orange">hackclub
                        newsletter!</span></p>
